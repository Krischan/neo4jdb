### Performance

In Bio4j data is organized in a way semantically equivalent to what it represents thanks to the graph structure. That means that queries which would even be impossible to perform with a standard Relational DB, can be feasible with Bio4j obtaining good performance results.

### Scalability

Bio4j is highly scalable. New data sources and features will be added from time to time and what it's more important, you can easily incorporate your own data to Bio4j so you can make the best out of it.

### Using a query language
